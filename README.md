# **Project Chimera Combat Evolution** ðŸš€

## DESCRIPTION

Built an FPS prototype in Ursina where the AI isn't just reading lines, it's *learning* lines. Uses Reinforcement Learning so enemies actually adapt to your moves. Basically, they get smarter. Good luck. ðŸ˜‰

## FEATURES

*   **Ursina Engine FPS Core:** Smooth 3D movement and shooting. You know, the basics. Gotta walk before you can blast. ðŸ”«
*   **Reinforcement Learning Combat AI:** NPCs with actual brains (kinda). They learn to fight *you* specifically using RL (think Stable Baselines3). No cap.
*   **Adaptive Tactical Response:** If you keep clapping them when they rush, they'll learn to chill and flank instead. Big brain plays only. ðŸ§ 
*   **Real-time Agent Training (Optional/Simplified):** Watch 'em get smarter mid-game (or between rounds). Like upgrading firmware, but for AI vendettas. âœ¨
*   **Minimalist Sci-Fi Arena:** A simple test zone with cover. Gotta give the AI *somewhere* to practice their flanking skills, right? Minimalist chic. ðŸ§±

## LEARNING BENEFITS

Level up your skills by smashing ML (specifically RL) into a live game. Get hands-on with Ursina, RL environments, reward tweaking, and figuring out why the AI suddenly loves hiding. It's basically a crash course in building Skynet, but fun. ðŸŽ“

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

*   `ursina`: For the pew-pew and the pretty pictures (game engine).
*   `tensorflow` | `pytorch`: The heavy lifters for the AI's thinking cap (ML backend). Choose your fighter.
*   `stable-baselines3` | `tf-agents`: Pre-built smarts to make the AI actually *learn* (RL library).
*   `numpy`: Because math is hard, let's use arrays (numerical stuff).
*   `gymnasium` (Optional): If you wanna get fancy structuring the AI's playground (RL environment).

## SETUP AND INSTALLATION

Easy peasy. Fire up your terminal and let's get this show on the road.

```bash
# Clone this masterpiece
git clone https://github.com/Omdeepb69/project-chimera-combat-evolution.git

# Jump into the directory
cd project-chimera-combat-evolution

# Install the goodies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Done. Next.

## USAGE

Just run the main Python script. Boom. ðŸ’¥ If you wanna tinker (go on, I know you do), check `config.json`.

## PROJECT STRUCTURE

Pretty standard stuff, nothing too wild:

*   `src/`: Where the magic happens (source code).
*   `tests/`: Making sure the magic doesn't blow up (unit tests).
*   `docs/`: Reading material, if you're into that (documentation).

MIT License. Basically, do what you want, just don't blame me if the AI takes over. ðŸ˜‰
